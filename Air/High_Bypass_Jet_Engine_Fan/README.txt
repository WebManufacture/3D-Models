# Summary

A high bypass fan inspired by Rolls-Royce's Trent series turbofans. Designed in CATIA, sliced in Simplify3D, and printed on a Makergear M2. The fan blades print separately from the disk and are designed to slide in, just like a real fan. The blades can stand up on their own, and the whole fan can also balance on the blade tips as shown in the first picture. This was a totally unintentional bonus feature and would've been difficult to design for. The white spiral stripe is printed flat, then dipped in hot water to soften and form around the black spinner cone - this step is tricky, but the end result is amazing. 

The clearances and gaps between the parts are as optimized as I could get them, so that parts aren't too tight or too loose. **Of course, results will vary depending on your printer and print settings.** Be careful about where the slicer assigns the start and end of each layer, especially for the fan blades - I recommend starting/ending each layer at either the blade's leading edge or trailing edge. You can see on one of the fan blades in the picture where the layer seam went diagonally across the back. This model begs to be printed in multiple colors! Enjoy! If anybody has problems with parts not fitting, please comment and I can upload a revised file.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerGear
Printer: M2
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .15mm
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
Printed using Hatchbox PLA. I didn't need rafts on anything, but I did have brims on the fan blades and annulus fillers. Fan blades don't require supports. The disk's supports are a nightmare to remove, but they're necessary.
